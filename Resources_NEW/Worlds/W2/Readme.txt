Between the bubbles should be the bridge with a lever nearby! (Just there to mark em)
Do add enemies and shit!


Also there are 2 passable walls, there will be a key there and a door below that passage.


Where there are 3 stars, there will be 3 levers(each below one star) and there will be a door on the right.
In order to open the door, you have to test out the levers and hit a right combination
Example ON OFF ON, or OFF ON OFF etc. You decide!
